  <title>Getting Started With the EasyBeans Maven Plugin</title>
  <section>
    <title>Getting EasyBeans Maven Plugin From the SVN Repository</title>
    <para>
      Anyone can check out source code from the SVN server using the
      following command or your favourite GUI SVN client:
    </para>

    <para>
      <screen>svn checkout svn://svn.forge.objectweb.org/svnroot/easybeans/sandbox/maven-easybeans-plugin</screen>
    </para>
  </section>
  <section>
    <title>Installing the plugin</title>
    <para>
      Once you have checked out the source code from the SVN server, you get at least two directories:
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            <filename class="folder">plugin</filename>
          </para>
          <para>
            Contains all sources to build the plugin.
          </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            <filename class="folder">examples</filename>
          </para>
          <para>
            Contains all sources of the examples to understand how to use the plugin.
          </para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      <para>
        To install the plugin to your Maven local repository, go into the <filename class="folder">plugin</filename> folder and use the following command:
        <screen>mvn install</screen>
      </para>
    </para>
  </section>
  <section>
    <title>Testing the examples</title>
      <section>
        <title>Bound to the Maven build lifecycle</title>
        <para>
          To test all the bound to the Maven build lifecycle examples (<emphasis>HelloWorld, Calculator, Directory and Directory-exploded</emphasis>), just
          use the following command in the <filename class="folder">examples</filename> folder:
          <screen>mvn integration-test</screen>
        </para>
      </section>
      <section>
        <title>Unbound to the the Maven build lifecycle</title>
        <para>
          To test the examples that are not bound to the Maven build lifecycle (contained in the <emphasis>Unbound-project</emphasis> module),
          use the following instructions:
        </para>
        <para>
          First, install and deploy the examples:
          <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
              <para>
                <screen>mvn install</screen>
              </para>
              <para>
                All the unbound examples are installed in the local repository.
              </para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
              <para>
                <screen>mvn easybeans:run</screen>
              </para>
              <para>
                EasyBeans is started and all the unbound EJB modules examples are deployed.
              </para>
            </listitem>
          </itemizedlist>
        </para>
        <para>
           Now, tests can be launched by using the following command in the <filename class="directory">Client</filename> module into another console:
           <screen>mvn exec:exec</screen>
        </para>
        <para>
          When tests are done, use the last following command in the directory of your choice:
          <screen>mvn easybean:stop</screen>
        </para>
